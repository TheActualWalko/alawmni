1. add new row to "clients" table in db
  - client_slug is IMPORTANT - it will be used to route to assets in step 3!
  - try to use an abbreviation of the client's name, without spaces or special characters (for example KCLLS, or UBLC)

2. use FileZilla to FTP into 51.255.193.170, username 'tom'

3. open the folder called 'clients' and add a new directory, with name exactly equal to the client_slug you added in step 1 (e.g. KCLLS or UBLC)
  - these names are case sensitive!

4. add a logo.png and a background.jpg in the new directory you just created
  - logo.png should be 180px tall and any width up to 700px, with transparency
  - background.jpg should be 2000px wide and about 320kb in size (adjust jpg quality until it's around there. if you can make the filesize even smaller without making it look like shit, go for it!)

5. [Sam will typically do this] update client DNS settings to point to us. 
- for KCLLS we set the CNAME for alumni.kcllawsociety.com to vps439250.ovh.net
  domain:  vps439250.ovh.net
  IPv4:    51.255.193.170
  IPv6:    2001:41d0:0302:2100:0000:0000:0000:95c6
  Gateway: 2001:41d0:0302:2100:0000:0000:0000:0001
